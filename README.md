# City Road Network Manager

## Introduction  
This is a Java console application that manages a city's road connections using a graph structure. Each city is a node, and each road connecting two cities is an edge. This program helps users explore and manage routes between cities efficiently.

## Why This Application?  
This program shows how graph data structures can represent real-life scenarios like road networks. It helps users learn about graphs while providing a practical way to visualize connections.

## What It Can Do:
1. Add Cities: Add cities to the network.
2. Add Roads: Create road connections between cities.
3. Display All Roads: View all road connections in the network.
4. Display Connected Cities: See all cities connected to a specific city.

## How Does It Contribute?  
This application enhanced my understanding of graph structures and programming, while also serving as an educational tool for the community, with potential for route planning and optimization.
